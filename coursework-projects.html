			<h3> Cardboard Boat Design Competition </h3>
			<img src="/images/MAE200-Boat-Design-Competition-Cover.jpg" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				As an assignment for MAE 200, we competed in teams of five to design, build, and test a cardboard boat that could carry the most weight 
				using only a triangular piece of poster board and one foot of duct tape. This project was particularly challenging because we were provided 
				a triangular piece of poster board, rather than an easier shape to design around such as a square. This lead us to decide it was best 
				to make a boat shaped as a triangular prism. We maximised the internal volume in order to displace as much water as possible and maximize 
				our weight capacity. We made and tested several prototypes to evaluate stability with load. We learned to mark the center of boyancy and place 
				the weight there evenly. We calculated the boat should be able to hold 11.5 lbs, and it ended up holding just over 13! This project taught me a 
				lot about the design process, how to design within given constraints, and the importance of calculation accuracy.

			<h3> Freshman Engineering Design Day 2018 </h3>
			<img src="/images/FEDD-3D-Printed-Water-Filter-Cover.jpg" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				As part of Engineering 101, our team of four students competed to design the best 3D printed device that would be useful on vacation. 
				We decided to create a 3D printed water filter to use when camping because several of us had experieinced running out of clean water while 
				camping. We also wanted our project to have potential implications on a global problem, and water scarcity seemed apropriate. Our design 
				used stackable sections that each contained a different filter material: cotton pads, sand, and activated charcoal. We designed each section 
				to snap inside the next, so that no additional fasteners were required. This also allowed for much easier cleaning than the backflushing 
				process required by commercial filters. While similar products run from $30 to $100 at stores like REI, we were able to make a functional 
				filter that completely clarified mud for only $4 in materials. While this filter likely isn't as effective at filtering out bacteria, we 
				think the technoplogy could nonetheless be scaled up and iterated to produce a safe, effective, and cheap water filter.
