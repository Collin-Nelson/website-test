			<h2 style="text-align:center"> Summary </h2>
				<p>
					Practical third-year mechanical engineering student with robotics, additive manufacturing, and traditional manufacturing experience. 
					Passionate about engineering with several large individual and group projects completed, including designing and building a large 
					format desktop 3D printer and over 1000 hours designing and fabricating competition robots for the FIRST Robotics Competition.
				</p>
			
			<h2 style="text-align:center"> A Bit About Me </h2>
				<h5> Background </h5>
				<p>
					I am a university student, undergraduate researcher, and engineer at heart. I enjoy all kinds of engineering project work, but I 
					primarily design and build things I need in my daily life. My motivations for projects are to better understand a system or technology 
					and to learn more about each subject, as well as to challenge myself to build each cheaper or better than what is commercially availible.
					I have built everything from a mini-fridge to a 3D printer, and I continue to use and refine these projects as I observe oppertunities 
					for improvement. 
				</p>
				<h5> Favorite Projects </h5>
				<p>
					While I have been a part of many projects, I found some more challenging and engaging than others. I struggle to pick a favorite project,
					as there are aspects of each that I have really enjoyed. My 3D printer is a top pick because it was my first independent engineering 
					project, and I am thrilled at how well it turned out. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the teamwork that characterized my time in 
					FIRST Robotics, and later in Ri3D as a part of the FIRST Alumni Associaction at NC State. I also had a lot of fun trying to use primerily
					recycled materials when building my minifridge to be an efficient system, but cost less than half what I could buy a similar unit for.
				</p>
				<h5> Hobbies </h5>
				<p>
					Outside of my formal responsibilities and project work, I like cycling, camping, hiking, and reading. 
					I regularly cycle to work and classes, as this is significantlty healthier and helps me to be happier and more fufilled. There is a 
					sense of your surroundings that cannot be gained from behind a windshield, and I much prefer to hear, feel, and smell my surroundings, 
					as well as see them. I'd take biking in the rain over traffic any day. I also like to camp by bike, called bicycle touring. This allows 
					me to get a similar experience to backpacking, but see much more, as I can cover over 80 miles a day by bike, vs. only 15 miles a day 
					when hiking. Another intrest of mine is reading. I read everything that sounds interesting to me, from non-fiction tutorial and 
					self-improvement books to fantasy and science fiction. My favorite novel of all time is Ender's Game, which I was initially introduced 
					to when my mother's employer used it as a study on leadership qualities and effective team-building. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a plethora of interests, but engineering is my greatest passion. I spend most of my time attending classes to earn my B.S. in 
					Mechanical Engineering, working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Center for Additive Manufacturing and Logistics on NCSU's 
					Centennial Campus, and the other club and personal projects I am involved in.
