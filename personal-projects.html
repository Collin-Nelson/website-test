			<h3> Eagle Scout Service Project </h3>
			<img src="/images/Eagle-Project-Cover.jpeg" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				My Eagle Scout Service Project was to plan and lead the construction of a 100 square foot outbuilding for my high school's football concessions. 
				I researched shed building and determined what was needed, then modified framing plans to fit. I then created a materials list and cut list, and 
				planned out how I would lead the construction, when most of the scouts helping me would be ages 10 to 16. I determined that for the project to run 
				smoothly and quickly, I would need to organize the project so that each of the walls could be built at the same time. I therefore designed framing 
				kits, which contained all the material for each wall, as well as instructions. That way, I could lead construction of the fountation and the framing 
				and sheathing of the floor while the walls were being built. All told, my Eagle project took nearly 700 man-hours to plan and build, with 45 people 
				helping me. Through this project, I developed project planning and leadership skills, as well as the ability to adapt and overcome problems on the fly.

			<h3> 3D Printer 2018 </h3>
			<img src="/images/3D-Printer-2018-Cover.jpg" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				My first significant engineering project was building a 3D printer during my third and fourth years of high school. It took me a year to 
				research, design, and build the first version, but this early prototype was only capable of crude prints with poor surface quality. After another 
				year of testing, evaluating, and refinment, I was able to achieve high print quality and dimensional accuracy with a second revision of the printer 
				and significant work in tuning the print parameters. While this revision printed much better, it began to have issues with the axes binding mid-print 
				on longer prints. This led to several failed prints before I identified the method of binding. In my first year of college, I was then able to design 
				another revision that avoided this binding issue. I have since moved on to other projects, but continue to infrequently modify the design of this 
				printer to improve its performance.
