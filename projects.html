			<h3> Robot in Three Days 2021 </h3>
			<img src="/images/placeholder.png" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				In three days, we revised our robot from Ri3D 2020 to better acomplish the 2021 challenge, which was similar to 2020's challenge due to COVID-19. 
				I led the build team to fix our ball intake system, repair the pnumatics, build and mount a mechanism to shoot balls, and install a gyroscope. 
				We worked slowly because of the additional distancing and sanitation requirements imposed by COVID, as well as having a significantly smaller team 
				spread over multiple locations across Raliegh and North Carolina. We worked hard to effectively communicate between workshops, utilizing 
				walkie-talkies and a remote CAD team to help each build site understand how different components would fit together on the final robot. Our 
				biggest challenge was designing components to fit together properly, as everything fabricated at the remote sites couldn't be brought to the 
				main space until the last day.

			<h3> Research and Development Club CNC </h3>
			<img src="/images/placeholder.png" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				Designing an epoxy-granite composite CNC machine in a group of about 25 students to be built and donated to the NC State Mechanical Engineering 
				department. We are creating a generatively designed frame using Autodesk Fusion 360 that will be cast in 3D printed molds. We lack the ability 
				to work with cast iron, so we will use epoxy-granite composite to fabricate a large, single-piece frame with excellent damping and rigidity 
				characteristics. Generative design will allow us to create a sturdy frame with the mechanical strength required of a CNC. Throughout this project 
				I have worked primerily on the spindle, including designing a mechanism to handle through-spindle coolent, depress the drawbar to allow automatic 
				tool changing, and still allow the spindle to be direct driven by a servo motor above the drawbar and coolent supply. The design of this part has 
				been especially challenging because both the drawbar force and the coolent have to be delivered through the mechanical power connection between 
				the motor and spindle.

			<h3> ASME Student Design Competition 2020 </h3>
			<img src="/images/placeholder.png" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				Worked to design a robot to build paper towers. Our robot had to be able to build three different types of towers; one that held the most weight, 
				one that held a small weight as high as possible, and one that was as tall as we could make it with limited time. The robot could be fed a single 
				sheet of paper at a time and remotely controlled, but had to do physically do all folding and construction itself. This challenge was particularly 
				because the robot to make these three towers had to fit in a 50 cm cube, yet be able to fold and stack paper quickly in a very strong manner. We 
				eventually settled on rolling paper into a tube, as the robot could hold each previous sheet inside the next sheet, keeping the tower from unrolling.
				This also meant we didn't have to fold paper, just feed it into the robot, roll it into a tube, and feed the assembled tube upward. While we learned 
				a lot through the process of designing and prototyping this system, COVID-19 lockdowns in March meant we were unfortunately never able to build and 
				test a full robot.

			<h3> Robot in Three Days 2020 </h3>
			<img src="/images/placeholder.png" class="cover-img">
			<p class="projects-p">
				Faced with a multifaceted challenge, we devised strategy to score the most points, ideated mechanisms, and built a functioning robot in three 
				days. This was our first time trying to build a robot in three days and the semester began halfway through, but we were still able to finish 
				and mount most of the mechanisms to the robot. We developed a system to pull balls in over the robot's outer frame and required "bumpers," then 
				transport balls through the middle of the robnot to be ejected into a goal several feet higher at the other end of the robot. We also had a 
				mechanism that extended to rotate a wheel above the robot until it detected the correct color. The final system was a climbing system that used 
				a latching hook that detached from an extendable arm when the winch began hoisting the robot off the ground. This climbing system, however, was 
				not able to be mounted before we ran out of time. We went through the engineering design process, first identifying the tasks we wanted to 
				accomplish, then designing mechanical systems out of the material on hand. We then tested and revised our designs until we developed a functioning 
				system.
